To create a 16x16 grid loop through a function that creates 16 containers
then inside that loop for each of the 16 containers created create 16 columns
All of those divs should have a class of white and a class of sketchpad


Setup a hover effect for each sketchpad item


Set Size of the sketchpad
In order to achieve this but keep the sketchpad the same size I have to 
change the resolution. In order to do that I need the container element
to be set to a specific size
